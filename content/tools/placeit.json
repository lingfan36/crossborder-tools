  "longDescription": "Placeit enables e-commerce sellers to create professional product mockups and marketing materials without photography equipment, models, or design skills. For cross-border sellers, especially those in print-on-demand or apparel, showing products in realistic lifestyle contexts dramatically increases conversions—but professional photo shoots are expensive and time-consuming. Placeit solves this with thousands of mockup templates featuring real models and environments. Simply upload your design, and it's automatically placed on t-shirts, mugs, phone cases, packaging, and more with realistic shadows and wrinkles. The video mockup feature creates animated product showcases perfect for social media ads. Beyond mockups, Placeit offers a logo maker for creating brand identities, social media templates for consistent content, and design tools for creating the actual graphics that go on your products. For print-on-demand sellers on platforms like Printful or Printify, Placeit is essential for creating listing images that compete with established brands. The unlimited subscription provides access to the entire library, making it cost-effective for sellers who need frequent mockups across multiple products.",
