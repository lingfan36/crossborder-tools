  "longDescription": "OpusClip is revolutionizing content repurposing for e-commerce marketers and creators. The AI analyzes long-form videos—whether product reviews, tutorials, or livestreams—and automatically identifies the most engaging moments to create short-form clips optimized for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. For cross-border sellers, this means one piece of content can be transformed into dozens of platform-ready clips without hours of manual editing. The AI doesn't just cut randomly; it understands context, identifies hooks, and ensures each clip tells a complete story. The virality score predicts which clips are most likely to perform well, helping you prioritize your posting strategy. Auto-generated captions with dynamic animations boost engagement, especially crucial for sound-off viewing. The platform also adds relevant B-roll footage to enhance visual interest. For sellers doing live commerce or creating long product demonstrations, OpusClip turns that content into a steady stream of short-form videos that drive traffic and sales across all social platforms.",
