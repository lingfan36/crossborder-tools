  "longDescription": "Remove.bg has become the industry standard for instant background removal, using AI to deliver results that previously required skilled Photoshop work. For cross-border e-commerce sellers, clean product images with white or transparent backgrounds are essential for marketplace listings, ads, and website design. Remove.bg processes images in seconds with remarkable accuracy, handling complex edges like hair, fur, and transparent objects that challenge other tools. The platform offers multiple ways to work: upload directly to the website, use the desktop app for batch processing, integrate via API for automated workflows, or use plugins for Photoshop and other design tools. For sellers with large catalogs, batch processing saves hours of manual editing. The API enables automated background removal as part of your product photography workflow. While the free version limits resolution, paid plans deliver full HD quality suitable for any use. For dropshippers using supplier photos, Remove.bg helps create consistent, professional imagery that builds trust. The tool integrates seamlessly with Canva and other design platforms, making it easy to place products on lifestyle backgrounds or create composite images.",
