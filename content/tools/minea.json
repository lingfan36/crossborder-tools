  "longDescription": "Minea stands out in the crowded ad spy market by offering comprehensive coverage across multiple platforms—TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and more—all in one tool. For cross-border e-commerce sellers, this multi-platform approach is invaluable because winning products often appear on one platform before spreading to others. By monitoring all channels, you can identify trends earlier and understand which platforms work best for different product types. The ad database contains millions of ads with detailed metrics including engagement, running time, and estimated spend. The influencer tracking feature reveals which products influencers are promoting, often a leading indicator of upcoming trends. Shop analysis lets you spy on competitor stores, seeing their best-selling products and marketing strategies. The Chrome extension enables research while browsing, instantly showing ad data for products you encounter. For sellers who advertise across multiple platforms, Minea's unified view saves the cost and complexity of subscribing to separate tools for each network. The platform is particularly strong for European markets, with good coverage of ads targeting EU countries.",
