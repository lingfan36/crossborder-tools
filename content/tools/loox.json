  "longDescription": "Loox transforms customer reviews into your most powerful sales tool by focusing on visual social proof. For cross-border e-commerce sellers, trust is the biggest barrier to conversion—customers hesitate to buy from unfamiliar international stores. Loox solves this by automatically collecting photo and video reviews from customers, then displaying them beautifully throughout your store. The visual nature of these reviews is far more persuasive than text alone, showing real customers with real products. The automated review request system sends perfectly timed emails after delivery, offering discounts in exchange for photo reviews to maximize collection rates. Loox's widgets integrate seamlessly into product pages, homepages, and even checkout, providing social proof at every decision point. The platform also syncs reviews to Google Shopping, improving your ad performance with star ratings. For dropshippers concerned about product quality perception, authentic customer photos build confidence that stock images never can. The built-in referral program turns happy customers into brand advocates. Loox has helped thousands of stores increase conversion rates by 15-30% through the power of visual social proof.",
