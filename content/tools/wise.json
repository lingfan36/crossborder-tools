  "longDescription": "Wise (formerly TransferWise) has revolutionized international money transfers by offering the real mid-market exchange rate with transparent, low fees. For cross-border e-commerce sellers, this translates to significant savings when paying suppliers, receiving payments, or converting currencies. Traditional banks hide fees in inflated exchange rates—Wise shows you exactly what you'll pay upfront, typically saving 3-5% compared to bank transfers. The multi-currency account lets you hold balances in 40+ currencies, receiving money with local bank details in USD, EUR, GBP, and more. This is invaluable for sellers operating across multiple markets. The Wise Business account adds features like batch payments for paying multiple suppliers, team access controls, and accounting integrations. The Wise debit card lets you spend in any currency at the real exchange rate, perfect for business travel or online purchases. For e-commerce sellers paying Chinese suppliers, Wise offers competitive rates for CNY transfers. The platform serves over 16 million customers and moves billions monthly, making it one of the most trusted names in international payments.",
