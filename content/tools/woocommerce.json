  "longDescription": "WooCommerce transforms any WordPress website into a powerful e-commerce store, offering cross-border sellers complete control and flexibility that hosted platforms can't match. As an open-source solution, WooCommerce is free to use with no transaction fees eating into your margins—you only pay for hosting and any premium extensions you choose. For sellers who want full ownership of their store and data, this is invaluable. The WordPress ecosystem provides unlimited customization possibilities through thousands of themes and plugins, letting you build exactly the store you envision. WooCommerce excels for content-driven commerce, making it ideal for sellers who rely on SEO and blogging to drive traffic. The platform supports unlimited products, variations, and digital downloads. For cross-border sellers, extensions enable multi-currency pricing, international shipping calculations, and localized payment gateways. While WooCommerce requires more technical knowledge than Shopify, the trade-off is complete freedom and potentially lower long-term costs. For established businesses with specific requirements or those scaling beyond basic platform limitations, WooCommerce offers the flexibility to build a truly custom e-commerce experience.",
