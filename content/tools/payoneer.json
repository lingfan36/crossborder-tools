  "longDescription": "Payoneer has become essential infrastructure for cross-border e-commerce sellers who need to receive payments from international marketplaces and pay suppliers globally. The platform provides local receiving accounts in USD, EUR, GBP, and other major currencies, allowing you to receive payments as if you had a local bank account in those countries—without actually being there. For Amazon sellers, Payoneer integrates directly with Amazon's payment system across all marketplaces, consolidating your global earnings into one account. The same applies to other platforms like Walmart, Wish, and major freelance marketplaces. When it's time to pay suppliers, Payoneer offers competitive exchange rates and low fees for international transfers. The prepaid Mastercard lets you access your funds anywhere, useful for business expenses while traveling. For agencies and businesses with multiple payees, the mass payout feature streamlines paying contractors and suppliers. While Payoneer's fees are higher than some alternatives like Wise for simple transfers, the platform's marketplace integrations and multi-currency account features make it invaluable for sellers operating across multiple international platforms.",
