  "longDescription": "DSers has emerged as the leading AliExpress dropshipping solution after Oberlo's discontinuation, becoming the official AliExpress dropshipping partner. The platform revolutionizes order fulfillment by allowing sellers to process hundreds of orders with just a few clicks. The Supplier Optimizer feature automatically finds better suppliers offering lower prices or faster shipping for your existing products. DSers supports multiple store management, letting you run several Shopify stores from one dashboard—perfect for testing different niches or markets. The variant mapping system handles complex products with multiple options seamlessly. Real-time inventory sync prevents overselling by updating stock levels automatically. Tracking numbers are imported and synced to your store and PayPal automatically, reducing customer service inquiries. The platform integrates with Shopify, WooCommerce, and Wix, giving you flexibility in your e-commerce platform choice. For cross-border dropshippers, DSers' bundle products feature lets you create unique offerings by combining items from different suppliers.",
