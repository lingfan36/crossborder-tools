  "longDescription": "AliReviews solves one of the biggest challenges facing dropshippers: launching products with zero reviews. For cross-border sellers sourcing from AliExpress, this app lets you import existing product reviews—including photos—directly to your Shopify store, giving new products instant credibility. The import process is simple: find your product on AliExpress, and AliReviews pulls in authentic customer reviews with one click. You can filter by rating, select only photo reviews, and translate reviews into your store's language. Beyond importing, AliReviews also collects reviews from your own customers through automated post-purchase emails. The customizable review widgets display beautifully on product pages, building the social proof that converts browsers into buyers. For stores selling products from multiple suppliers, AliReviews handles the complexity of managing reviews across your entire catalog. The platform supports multiple languages, essential for cross-border stores serving international customers. While some debate the ethics of imported reviews, they represent real feedback from real customers who purchased the same product—just from a different seller.",
