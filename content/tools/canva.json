Canva provides over 250,000 templates optimized for every platform and purpose, from Instagram stories to Amazon A+ content. The drag-and-drop editor makes customization intuitive, while the massive library of stock photos, graphics, and fonts ensures you always have the assets you need. AI-powered features like Magic Write generate copy, Magic Resize adapts designs for different platforms instantly, and background removal cleans up product photos. The Brand Kit feature stores your colors, fonts, and logos for consistent branding across all content. For teams, real-time collaboration enables multiple people to work on designs simultaneously. Canva Pro unlocks premium templates, unlimited storage, and advanced features, though the free version is remarkably capable. For e-commerce sellers producing daily content across multiple platforms, Canva's speed and ease of use make professional design accessible and efficient.",
