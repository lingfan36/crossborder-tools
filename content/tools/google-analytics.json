  "longDescription": "Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the essential analytics platform for any e-commerce business, providing deep insights into how visitors interact with your store. For cross-border sellers, GA4 reveals which countries drive the most traffic and conversions, helping you prioritize markets. The enhanced e-commerce tracking follows the entire customer journey from first visit to purchase, showing where customers drop off. Conversion funnels visualize your checkout process, identifying friction points that cost you sales. Audience insights reveal demographics, interests, and behaviors of your visitors. The acquisition reports show which marketing channels deliver the best ROI—crucial for optimizing ad spend. GA4's machine learning surfaces insights automatically, alerting you to significant changes in traffic or conversions. Integration with Google Ads enables powerful remarketing and conversion optimization. Custom reports and dashboards let you focus on metrics that matter to your business. While GA4 has a learning curve compared to the previous Universal Analytics, its event-based model provides more flexible and accurate tracking for modern e-commerce.",
