  "longDescription": "Submagic has become essential for anyone creating short-form video content for e-commerce. In a world where 85% of social media videos are watched without sound, captions aren't optional—they're critical for engagement and conversions. Submagic goes beyond basic subtitles by generating dynamic, animated captions that match the energy of viral TikTok content. The AI automatically transcribes your video and applies trendy caption styles with word-by-word highlighting, emoji integration, and smooth animations. For cross-border sellers, this means every product video, testimonial, or ad can capture attention even when viewers are scrolling silently. The platform offers multiple caption styles to match your brand aesthetic, from bold and energetic to clean and professional. What would take hours in traditional editing software takes minutes with Submagic. The one-click export feature delivers platform-optimized files ready for posting. For TikTok Shop sellers and dropshippers creating daily content, Submagic dramatically speeds up the editing workflow while ensuring every video has the polished, professional look that drives engagement.",
