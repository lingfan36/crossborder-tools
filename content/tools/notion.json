  "longDescription": "Notion has become the operating system for modern e-commerce businesses, providing a flexible workspace that adapts to any workflow. For cross-border sellers juggling multiple suppliers, products, and marketplaces, Notion brings order to chaos. Create product databases that track inventory, costs, suppliers, and performance metrics. Build SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) that document every process from order fulfillment to customer service responses. The team collaboration features keep virtual teams aligned across time zones with shared workspaces, comments, and real-time editing. Notion's template gallery offers pre-built systems for inventory management, content calendars, and project tracking. The powerful database views—table, board, calendar, gallery—let you visualize data however works best. Notion AI assists with writing, summarizing, and brainstorming, boosting productivity. API integrations connect Notion to your other tools, creating automated workflows. For solo entrepreneurs, Notion serves as a second brain capturing ideas, research, and plans. For teams, it becomes the central hub where knowledge lives and work gets done.",
