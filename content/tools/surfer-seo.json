  "longDescription": "Surfer SEO takes the guesswork out of content optimization by analyzing what's actually ranking on Google and providing data-driven recommendations. For cross-border e-commerce sellers investing in content marketing, Surfer ensures every blog post, category page, and product description is optimized to compete for search rankings. The Content Editor is the core feature—it analyzes top-ranking pages for your target keyword and provides real-time guidance on word count, keyword usage, headings, and semantic terms to include. As you write, a content score updates, showing exactly how well-optimized your content is compared to competitors. The SERP Analyzer reveals why certain pages rank, examining over 500 ranking factors. For stores with existing content, the Content Audit feature identifies pages that could rank higher with optimization. Surfer's AI writing assistant can generate SEO-optimized drafts, though human editing improves quality. The platform integrates with Google Docs, WordPress, and Jasper for seamless workflows. For e-commerce sellers serious about organic traffic, Surfer SEO provides the competitive intelligence needed to create content that actually ranks and drives sales.",
