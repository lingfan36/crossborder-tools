  "longDescription": "Gorgias is the customer support platform built specifically for e-commerce, making it the top choice for Shopify and online store owners. Unlike generic helpdesks, Gorgias deeply integrates with your store to display order information, process refunds, and update orders directly from the support ticket. The AI-powered automation handles up to 60% of common inquiries automatically—order status, shipping updates, return requests—freeing your team for complex issues. What sets Gorgias apart is its revenue focus: track how much revenue your support team generates through upsells and saved sales. The unified inbox consolidates email, chat, social media, SMS, and phone into one view. Powerful macros and rules automate repetitive tasks and route tickets to the right agents. For cross-border sellers, Gorgias supports multiple languages and integrates with translation tools. The platform connects with 100+ e-commerce apps including Klaviyo, Yotpo, and ReCharge. Real-time dashboards show response times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores. Gorgias transforms customer support from a cost center into a revenue driver.",
